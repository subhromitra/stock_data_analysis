# Analysis of Nifty data

## 1) Finding correlation between stocks

NIFTY100 data is fetched & processed properly to get correlations between all stocks. This helps in creating our portfolio for investment in the following ways :-

* Having stocks in our portfolio which are uncorrelated to each other thereby reducing internal risk.
* Using a pair-trading strategy & having 2 stocks which are negatively correlated to each other, thus we can buy one stock when it goes up & short the other.
